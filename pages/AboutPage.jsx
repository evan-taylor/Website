              Hi! I'm Evan. Born and raised in Vancouver, WA, I've always been fascinated by computers. My journey into programming began in 8th grade when I decided to teach myself how to code. This early interest solidified my decision to pursue Computer Science as my majorâ€”a path I've stayed committed to throughout high school.

              At 16, I began working as a Lifeguard, which sparked my interest in health and safety training. This experience led me to found Taylored Instruction LLC, an American Red Cross Licensed Training Provider and American Heart Association Training Site. We're dedicated to delivering high-quality health and safety training, including CPR courses and Lifeguard certification, to our community.
